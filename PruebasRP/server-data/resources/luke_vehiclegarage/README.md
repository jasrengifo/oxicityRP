FiveM mod that adds garages and impounds for the ESX framework

This resource adds vehicle garages for cars (including trucks and stuff), boats and aircrafts.
You can configure the location of each garage, return circle and spawn coordinates in the config file.
The resource is using WarMenu made by Warxander.
In the config you can choose whether you want the damage on the vehicles to be saved, fuel will always save not depending on what you choose.
Depending on the damage on the car when you it's stored, when you take it out the script will do damage to it to make it look visually damaged.
The impound checks whether the vehicle is already in the world to prevent vehicle duping.
If you want you can have all the vehicles be stored in the garage automatically on resource (or server) restart (check server.lua for this).
